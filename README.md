### VERSIONING

For transparency and insight into our development cycle, and for striving to
maintain backward compatibility, MxitConnectionHelper will be maintained under
the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and
  patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and
  resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
